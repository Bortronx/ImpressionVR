# ImpressionVR
Impression is a VR experience that lets you view a vast amount of images at once. All these images are striped of all text that may persuade your judgment. This unbiased approach lets users of any age, background, occupation or business be part of the experience. The goal is to match you with another user that has the same interests as yourself through what you like to see. Literally constructing the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words" This is accomplished through randomized photo generation based on your personnel interests. This way of generating images does not discriminate since images don't show ownership or any personal information about the contents of the image be it business, place, or people.
